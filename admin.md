# Instructions for Client Admin for Gen AI Hackathon

##Â Create a project for the hackathon

## Create a service account

You should give the service account the following roles: 

- `Vertex AI User`
- `Big Query Admin`

You should distribute the `credentials.json` file to each participant so they can impersonate the service account for the hackathon.

## Create a Vertex AI workbench instance for each user

This should be of the new **instances** type, not a user-managed or managed notebook.
