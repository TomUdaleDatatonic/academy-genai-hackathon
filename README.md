# Datatonic Academy Gen AI Hackathon

## Introduction

Welcome! 

Today you will be creating your own analytics assistant, which can use your Big Query data to answer business questions in natural language! We will use the following tools to build our solution:

- Backend
    - **PaLM API** from Vertex AI
    - **BigQuery** as our database to hold our data
    - **Langchain**, to coordinate our Large Language Models with our datasets
- Frontend
    - **Gradio** for creating a chat frontend so we can talk to our assistant.

## Format 

The event today will have two main components, learning the tools and creating the analytics assistant.

### Learning the tools

Here you will have the opportunity to try out the tools you will need to build a functioning Gen AI prototype. There are several notebooks in the `learn-the-tools` directory. When instructed to do so, please work through each of these notebooks to gain the pre-requisite knowledge for the analytics assistant challenge. The focus of these exercises will be on the backend technologies, rather than on creating the frontend for chatting. 

### Analytics Assistant

Well done! Having gained the required knowledge, you are now in a position to build your own analytics assistant using PaLM and Langchain. There are several options for you during the challenge, as denoted by the notebooks. There is one which has very bare-bones instructions, one which has the skeleton and requires you to fill out certain aspects, and one which is a fully functional solution and only requires the correct constants to be inputted. Please choose the level you would like to work at.

You can find the instructionsi in the `analytics-assistant` directory. Good Luck!
